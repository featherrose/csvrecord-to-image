# csvrecord-to-image
Using a JSON template file, create card images based on input CSV records.

A basic web server hosts an interface (i.e., a website) which allows the user to specify a template, then upload a CSV file.
The website runs server-side code which parses the CSV records and generates card images based on them (using the specified template).
Then, it outputs the card images to the user.

I haven't had time to document this properly, and it's still a work-in-progress, but I'm sharing it anyway since some folks were interested.

Start with web-build.sh and follow the breadcrumbs. Let me know if any files are obviously missing.
Good luck.
